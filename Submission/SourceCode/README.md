## Running of Codes
All our codes are done on Jupyter Notebook. Pandas and Numpy libaries are required to run the codes.

### Part 2 
The codes are in Part2/Part2.ipynb
Change the different datasets location in the "Pathings" block. The output will be a dev.prediction file.

### Part 3
The codes required for Part 3 is in Part3/Part3.ipynb & Part3/Part3_Preprocess.ipynb. 
The first step is to run Part3/Part3_Preprocess.ipynb to generate the .csv output file. The next and final step is to run Part3/Part3.ipynb and load the previous .csv output file from the first step and generate the dev.prediction file.

### Part 4
The codes required for Part 4 is in Part4/Part4.ipynb & Part3/Part3_Preprocess.ipynb.
The first step is to run Part3/Part3_Preprocess.ipynb to generate the .csv output file. The next and final step is to run Part4/Part4.ipynb and load the previous .csv output file from the first step and generate the best 3rd dev.prediction file.

### Part 5
The codes required for Part 5 is in Part5/Part5.ipynb & Part5/Part5_Preprocess.ipynb.
The first step is to run Part5/Part5_Preprocess.ipynb to generate the .csv output file. The next and final step is to run Part5/Part5.ipynb, change the filepaths to the required files and load the previous .csv output file from the first step and generate the dev.prediction file.
